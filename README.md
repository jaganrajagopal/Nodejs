**How to create the Node js application with step by step instruction 
**

Creating a simple Node.js web application involves setting up a basic server that can handle web requests. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a sample Node.js application:
**Step 1: Setting Up Your Project**
First, create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js application.

Create a Directory:


mkdir my-nodejs-app

cd my-nodejs-app 

**Initialize a Node.js Application:**

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
This will create a package.json file in your directory, which will manage your application's dependencies.

**Step 2: Install Express**
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Install it using npm:


npm install express


**Step 3: Since already app.js has been created in the git**


Imports the Express module.
Creates an Express application.
Sets up a route handler for GET requests to the root URL (/) that sends back a "Hello World!" message.

Starts the server and makes it listen on port 3000.

**Step 4: Running Your Application**
Run your application by executing:


node app.js
You should see a message in your terminal saying Server running at http://localhost:3000/. You can visit this URL in your web browser to see your application running.
